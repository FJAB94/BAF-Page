# FAB-Page
## Welcome! This is my portfolio.
My name is Franco Aguilar, here you'll find some samples of my work as a web programmer, inspired by my previous career as an Argentine tango musician.
Any suggestions are welcome!

## Site Map
I made this site with a minimalist vision so you will find these two pages:
* **Home** - Here I've included a few sections, starting with a brief overview of my career as an artist and developer. Then we continue with my portfolio cards in a condensed version. Finally, a contact section.
* **Portfolio** - Then we have a separate page for the portfolio where I put more details about the projects I develop. 
* **About Me** - This donÂ´t need any explanation, here i just tell my story.
